# Description
NextClientServerApi is an amxmodx module that provides an API to interact with Counter-Strike 1.6 NextClient.

See API functions in [next_client_api.inc](https://github.com/CS-NextClient/NextClientServerApi/blob/main/addons/amxmodx/scripting/include/next_client_api.inc).

# Features

- The cvar sandbox. Allows you to set the value of a cvar to the client and locks it to be changed by the client. cvar value on the client is reset to the user's value after disconnecting from the server.
- Effects for viewmodel. Allows you to set rendering effects for viewmodels, as well as skin and body.
- Sprite management api. Allows you to display sprites on the screen.
- Extended fov message. Allows you to set the interpolation time of the fov change.
- Override of deathmsg weapon sprites. Allows you to customize weapon icons in kill feed.

Coming soon:
- Separate precaching for regular cs 1.6 client and NextClient.
- Precaching hud.txt and default sprites.

> ðŸ’Ž **USING OF THE API TO GRANT PRIVILEGES** <br />
Since `NextClientServerApi 1.4.0` we introduced a verification method for players playing with nextclient by using `ncl_is_using_nextclient` native and some [RSA public keys](https://github.com/CS-NextClient/NextClientServerApi/tree/main/addons/amxmodx/data/nextclient_api/pkeys) which should be installed on the server to make verification work.<br />
The verification process is carried out only by nextclient since version `2.3.0`, where support for the new client-server protocol was introduced. For earlier versions, it is unfortunately impossible to reliably determine whether a player uses nextclient.<br />
Here is an example of using verification to provide access flags for players playing with updated nextclient:
```c++
#include <amxmodx>
#include <next_client_api>

new const VIP_FLAGS[] = "f"; // the vip flags we are providing

public ncl_client_api_ready(id) {
	// Check that the player has verified nextclient
	if(ncl_is_using_nextclient(id) == NCL_USING_VERIFICATED)
		set_user_flags(id, read_flags(VIP_FLAGS));
}
```

## Building

Building NextClientServerApi requires CMake 3.10+ and GCC or MSVC compiler with C++11 support. Tested compilers are:

* GCC 9.4.0
* MSVC 2019

Building the library is done using CMake. You can run the CMake GUI to configure the library or use the command line:

```
mkdir Release
cd Release
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .. --target nextclientapi_amxx
```
