// Unlike snprintf(), strncpy() doesn't necessarily null-terminate the
// target.  It appears the former function reasonably considers the given
// size to be "max size of target string" (including the null-terminator),
// whereas strncpy() strangely considers the given size to be "total number
// of bytes to copy".  Note strncpy() _always_ writes n bytes, whereas
// snprintf() writes a _max_ of n bytes (incl the NULL).  If strncpy()
// needs to write extra bytes to reach n, it uses NULLs, so the target
// _can_ be null-terminated, but only if the source string would have fit
// anyway -  in which case why not just use strcpy() instead?
//
// Thus, it appears strncpy() is not only unsafe, it's also inefficient,
// and seemingly no better than plain strcpy() anyway.
//
// With this logic, strncpy() doesn't appear to be much of a "str" function
// at all, IMHO.
//
// Strncat works better, although it considers the given size to be "number
// of bytes to append", and doesn't include the null-terminator in that
// count.  Thus, we can use it for what we want to do, by setting the
// target to zero-length (NULL in first byte), and copying n-1 bytes
// (leaving room for the null-termiator).
//
// Why does it have to be soo haaard...

// statements into one, for use in situations like non-braced else
// statements.
